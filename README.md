# GraphTheoryBasics
Video and syllabus from the ISMRM tutorial on graph theory

The primary presentation is the .mp4 file about brain network analysis, and had to be posted to Youtube because it is too big to post here. The course assignment gives interactive exercises that you can do along with the presentation.
